=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Perl::OSType ':all';

  $current_type = os_type();
  $other_type = os_type('dragonfly'); # gives 'Unix'

  $is_sun = is_os_family("Sun");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Modules that provide OS-specific behaviors often need to know if
the current operating system matches a more generic type or family of
operating systems. For example, 'linux' is a type of 'Unix' operating system
and so is 'freebsd'.

This module provides a mapping between an operating system name as given by
C<$^O> and a more generic type.  The initial version is based on the OS type
mappings provided in L<Module::Build> and L<ExtUtils::CBuilder>.  (Thus,
Microsoft operating systems are given the type 'Windows' rather than 'Win32'.)

=head2 OS Families

L<Devel::CheckOS> introduced the notion of OS families, which do not
necessarily correspond to types.  An operating system can belong to multiple
families.  Supported families include the following (descriptions are taken
nearly verbatim from Devel::CheckOS):

=over 4

=item *

Unix

Broadly speaking, these are platforms where:

=over

=item *

Devices are represented as pseudo-files in the filesystem

=item *

Symlinks and hardlinks are supported in at least some filesystems

=item *

"Unix-style" permissions are supported; That is, there are seperate read/write/execute permissions for file owner,
group and anyone.  This implies the presence of multiple user accounts
and user groups.  Permissions may not be supported on all filesystems.

=item *

The filesystem has a single root

=item *

The C API for the operating system is largely POSIX-compatible

=back

=item *

Apple, DEC, Sun

These include any OS written by, respectively, Apple, DEC, and Sun.
They exist because, while, eg, Mac OS Classic and Mac OS X are very
different platforms, they do support some unique features - such as
AppleScript.  Vendor families may also have similar known issues or
incompatibilities, such as with Sun's 'tar' program.

=item *

MicrosoftWindows

This includes any version of Windows and also includes things like
Cygwin which run on top of it.

=item *

Realtime

This is for all real-time OSes.  So far, it only includes QNX.

=head1 USAGE

No functions are exported by default. The export tag ":all" will export
all functions listed below.

=head2 os_type()

  $os_type = ostype();
  $os_type = ostype('MSWin32');

Returns a single, generic OS type for a given operating system name.  With no
arguments, returns the OS type for the current value of C<$^O>.  If the
operating system is not recognized, the function will return the empty string.

=head2 is_os_type()

  $is_windows = is_os_type('Windows');
  $is_unix    = is_os_type('Unix', 'dragonfly');

Given an OS type and OS name, returns true or false if the OS name is of the
given type.  As with C<os_type>, it will use the current operating system as a
default if no OS name is provided.

=head2 os_family()

  @names = os_family('Apple');

Given an OS family, returns a list of OS names (as they would appear in
C<$^O>) that belong to the given family.  If the family name is not known, the
function will return an empty list.

=head2 is_os_family()

  $is_realtime  = is_os_family('Realtime');
  $is_sun       = is_os_family('Sun', 'solaris');

Given an OS family and an OS name, returns true or false if the OS name is
in the given family.  As with C<os_type>, it will use the current operating
system as a default if no OS name is provided.
